# Password.Generator - Homework 3

## Description

I was given the assignment to create a password generator based on what criteria the user asks for. The reason for all the criteria is because a secure password is necessary.

I did not get my final generater to actually show the password and I could not figure out why it was not outputting what I wanted. The console isn't showing any errors in my code. So I think I am missing a part or not calling on the right variable.

Challenges:
To be honest, this whole assignment was quite challenging. I needed to look up a lot of information on javascript functions and methods to see what I could use to get the result I wanted.

Things I can improve on:

- I definitely think I can make my code cleaner but I was shooting for functionality first, i.e. the way I set up the arrays and also the if/else statements
- I learned alot more about javascript methods but I need to practice using them so I understand how functions work better
